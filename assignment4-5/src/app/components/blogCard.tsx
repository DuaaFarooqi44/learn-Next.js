        detail: 'Here are some details about headphones:How they work Headphones are electroacoustic transducers that convert electrical signals into sound. They consist of small speakers, called drivers, that produce audio based on the signals they receive. Connection Headphones can connect to a device using a cord or wireless technology. Wired headphones use a cable to connect directly to a device, while wireless headphones use Bluetooth or other technologies to transmit audio signals without a physical connection. Styles Headphones come in different styles, including over-ear, on-ear, and in-ear. Each style offers different levels of comfort and sound quality. Audio quality Headphones can have different audio reproduction quality capabilities. For example, headphones designed for telephones typically cannot reproduce sound with the same high fidelity as headphones designed for music listening. Safety Listening to headphones at a high volume for a long time can increase the risk of deafness. Eco-friendly Some headphones are designed to be more sustainable, using materials made from recycled or renewable sources, energy-efficient technologies, and recyclable or biodegradable packaging' },

        detail: 'Coffee mugs can be made from a variety of materials, including glass, ceramic, metal, or plastic composites. Each material has different properties, so its important to choose one that suits your coffee-drinking habits: Stainless steel: Durable, but can be hard to handle if it doesnot have a heat-resistant handle. Stainless steel mugs are not microwave-safe and can impart off-flavors. Ceramic: Retains heat well and is comfortable to hold, but can chip or crack if mishandled. Most ceramic mugs are dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe. Glass: Provides the cleanest taste, but can be delicate and easily break. Plastic composites: Nearly indestructible, but donot retain heat as well as other materials. Many plastic mugs are not microwave-safe. Size Espresso cups are smaller than other coffee cups and are narrower at the base and wider at the rim. If the espresso cup is too big, the crema can spread out and fade quickly. Function A coffee mug should keep coffee warm and warm the drinkers hands without burning them. A flimsy cup can negatively impact the perception of the coffee quality.' },
